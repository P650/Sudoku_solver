# Sudoku_solver

The code uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It tries to fill in each cell with a number between 1 and 9 and checks if the number is valid based on the Sudoku rules. If the number is valid, it moves on to the next cell, and if it reaches the end of the puzzle, it returns True to indicate that the puzzle has been solved. If the number is not valid, it tries the next number, and if all numbers fail, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number.

Finally, the function returns False if the puzzle cannot be solved. The solved puzzle is stored in the matrix variable.
